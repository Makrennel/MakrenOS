# This is intended to be run by a systemd service on boot to make all users use zsh by default unless explicitly set to false
# Changing shell to zsh permanently can make it difficult to log into the system if you decide to rebase to a different image, so this is just to be safe
# Unfortunately, user services don't appear to start early enough to force the first shell upon login to be zsh, so this hack has to be used
